In big lines what it will do:
connect to device
send ping to other devices on the same network
get that outcome and write it down somewhere



Extra features:
- use hostnames, give IP address as well
- lookup MAC addresses of the hostnames, show to the user
    - do a lookup for the first half, to see who is the vendor, what kind of device is connected
- give it a file so it can go trough the list
